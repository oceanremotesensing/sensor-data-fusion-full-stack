# Sensor Data Fusion - Full Stack

This project implements the three main pillars Sensor Data Fusion, that is:

- prediction
- filtering
- retrodiction

as described in [Wolfgang Koch's book Tracking and Sensor Data Fusion](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642392702).

To realize this, we need a set of features:

1. Generation of sensor data from one or many sensors with some added noise.
2. Visualization of the true and the SDF-stack generated approximations.
3. An UI to learn through play (optional)
